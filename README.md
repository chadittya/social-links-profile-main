### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to:

- Implement a responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Create reusable components in React
- Use Next.js for server-side rendering and optimized performance
- Implement hover and focus states for interactive elements

Here's an example of a reusable component I created:

- [SocialLink.tsx](./app/components/SocialLink.tsx)

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus on:

- Improving accessibility features
- Implementing more complex state management
- Exploring advanced Next.js features

### Useful resources

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - This helped me understand the basics of Next.js and its features.
- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - An excellent resource for learning how to use Tailwind CSS effectively.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
or
yarn dev
or
pnpm dev
or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font, and Material Icons.
